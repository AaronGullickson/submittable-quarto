Some goals here:

* endnotes option. This is mosly working through the endnotes package but I can't get its placement before references.
* endfloat option. Option to move all tables and figures to the bottom. I can add this to package but then it automically happens rather than as an option in the YAML. I am not sure how to optionally load a package based on yaml parameter because it seems like you can't access yaml parameters in the header and you can't load packages outside the header.
* Option for either fully anonymous, or a separate title page. 
* I am currently handling double spacing with linestretch. However this also creates double spacing in tables. See if I can adjust that for tables. I think my old R Markdown template was able to do this.
* Put these comments in proper issues on GH and make this a real README!
* Make a better template that tests things I want.
* A word document template.
